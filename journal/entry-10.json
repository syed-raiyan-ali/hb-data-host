I told you how sidelined I felt, especially when I saw how often you updated Deane. And I know that was hard to hear, and maybe even harder for you to understand. But I said it because I want this us to be something we can both stand in proudly, not something I have to tiptoe through. I love Liyan. Not like a stranger who’s dating her mom. Like someone who already feels a kind of protective softness toward her. And I love you in a way that aches when I feel invisible in the very life I want to belong to. But when you said 'I love you so much' in the middle of all that, I believed it. Because love doesn’t always arrive with answers sometimes it just shows up, wounded and willing. And we both stayed. That counts for something."
