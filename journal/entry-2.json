You were teasing, playful, and so charming without trying. We didn’t even talk for long that day, but it stuck that casual way you said, 'Can I call just for a sec? I wanna hear you speak.' You had no idea how much that meant. I was surrounded by family in the room but still smiling like a fool under the blanket because you made me feel seen in such a loud world. And somehow, I already felt safe."
