We argued more, misunderstood each other more, but even in those sharp moments, I never stopped loving you. I started noticing the way you responded slower, how your words became less detailed and I’ll be honest, it hurt. Not because I need constant attention, but because I missed you even when you were right there. And still, I stayed. Because loving you wasn’t a conditional thing for me. One night, after a fight, you still said 'goodnight, my baby' and I broke a little. Not because it fixed everything, but because it reminded me that we still choose each other, even when it’s messy. Even when we’re tired. There was a gentleness to how you called me back after a silent day, like you knew I was waiting but didn’t want to make it worse. I don’t expect perfect love. But I’ll take honest, clumsy, committed love with you every damn time."
