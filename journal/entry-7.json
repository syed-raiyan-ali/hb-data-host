  "content": "April was warm in a slow, aching way. The kind of month where everything blooms but not without struggle. You started opening up more, and every piece you offered a joke, a story from your past, a sleepy rant felt like a little folded paper heart placed in my palm. I remember one night you laughed mid-argument, saying I looked grumpy even through texts, and just like that, the tension melted. That’s what you do to me. You disarm my fears so casually it feels like magic. I got used to your voice guiding me through the day, even when you were tired or sad. There was something about the way you'd say ‘my love’ not loudly, not dramatically, just naturally, like a truth already known. I used to think love was loud. But you showed me it could be slow, quiet, steady like a tide that keeps coming back, even if the shore changes. In April, you didn’t just become my comfort; you became my rhythm."
