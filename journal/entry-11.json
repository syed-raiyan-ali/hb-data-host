I noticed the drop in how you answered, the delay in sweetness, the shift in tone. And I kept telling myself: she’s tired, she’s stressed, she still loves you. And I think you do. I just think sometimes love gets buried under everything else, and I didn’t know how to dig it out without sounding clingy. So I tried to keep loving you loudly, just in case your silence wasn’t intentional. I told you how much I needed you, even when it made me feel too much. I tried to remind you of who we were the ‘good morning, babe’ team, the 'watching Liyan giggle through a call' duo. I didn’t want us to become another almost. So I waited. And even though it was hard, I waited because I still saw flickers of you in the dark and I know the full light of you is worth it."
