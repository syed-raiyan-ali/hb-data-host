  "content": "March felt like one of those soft indie films where nothing big happens, but everything shifts. We weren’t just texting anymore we were building little rituals. A good morning that meant 'I survived the night because you were somewhere in the world,' a goodnight that felt like a whispered kiss across screens. You’d call me while half-asleep, sometimes mumble that my voice was nice, and I’d pretend I didn’t replay that line for hours. There were days we fought over silly things timing, tone, overthinking but even then, the way you came back mattered. The way we both came back. I tried to learn your silences instead of fearing them. One night, when I was being dramatic and said you’d leave me someday, you just said, 'Don’t you ever say that again.' And I didn’t. Not because you told me not to but because for the first time, I started to believe I was staying somewhere safe."
