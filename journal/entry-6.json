  "content": "Do you remember that weird week when everything felt off? Our sleep was misaligned, Liyan had a fever, you were overwhelmed, and I was trying not to sound needy. And yet somehow, even then, you’d call not always to talk, sometimes just to breathe beside me. Those were the moments I knew we were more than just sweet texts and baby nicknames. You’d say 'babe' with that slow softness like you were saying 'home.' I started reading between your tired words how you’d still ask if I’d eaten, how you'd drop emojis even when your eyes were closing. There was this one morning you said, 'Liyan smiled at my phone screen when you talked,' and I swear my chest cracked open from how much love flooded in. I wasn’t just your boyfriend in those moments I was trying to become someone who deserved a forever with both of you. I know I’m not perfect, but I also know that love like this quiet, patient, foolishly hopeful isn’t common. And I’d choose you in every lifetime, even if it meant waiting in silence sometimes just to hear your laugh again."
