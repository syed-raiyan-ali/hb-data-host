You barely knew me, and still you called me 'Rai' like we’d always belonged to the same universe. I didn’t even know how to respond, so I just went along, pretending like my heart wasn’t already tangled in your words. And when you said you wanted to hear my voice? God, Oli. My whole body got shy and giddy like I was 16 again. You made the ordinary names, calls, little jokes feel like magic, and I didn’t even realize I was falling. That fast, but with this quiet sense of rightness."
