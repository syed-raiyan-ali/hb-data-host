I remember you calling me your 'best boy' and my cheeks heating up even though no one else was around. You'd say things like, 'I’ll call after lunch,' or 'Gonna nap for a bit,' and I’d actually wait, like your words were promises carved in time. We had so many good mornings, lazy evenings, and deep nights where we shared little wounds and wishes. I loved how easily we flowed not perfect, not dramatic just real. I felt like I was learning your rhythm and wanting to match it every time."
