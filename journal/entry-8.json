You didn't ask for reassurance, but I gave it anyway, because loving you isn't something I do on request it’s something I do on instinct. And that night, you let me. You didn’t push me away or change the topic or joke it off. You just... received it. Quietly. Maybe that’s why it stayed with me. We talk so much reels, silly things, flirty fights but when we share silences, I feel the most seen. That night I realized I’m not just in love with who you are when you're bright and strong. I’m deeply, helplessly in love with the version of you that struggles too. And I want to be the one who sits beside all of your moods the messy, moody, quiet, and chaotic not just the cheerful ones. Because you’re not just my person when you’re perfect. You’re mine in every shade."
