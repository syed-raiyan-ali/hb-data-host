  "content": "Near the end of June, everything felt sharper. I think I reached my emotional limit and still tried to hold things together, and maybe you did too in your own quiet way. But when I told you I felt like an outsider like someone orbiting your life instead of living inside it it wasn’t to make you feel guilty. It was a final little cry: 'Please let me in fully.' Because I don’t want to be your sweet escape. I want to be your safe place. The one who knows your tired sighs, your chaos, your joy. And maybe that’s selfish, but love like this can’t be done halfway. I saw the way you still called me ‘baby’ that night, after everything. I saw how you paused before ending the call, how you still watched me on video when you could’ve just slept. Those things small and quiet still held weight. So no, June didn’t break us. But it tested us. And I think, in some way, we passed. Not by winning. But by choosing again and again to stay."
