You made even the stupidest little comments sound like poetry. Like when you called Liyan a tiny queen and said we’d all make a weird little family one day. It was so ridiculous and beautiful and full of hope that I wanted to screenshot it and save it in my heart forever. I don’t even remember what we were doing in the background I just remember how warm your words felt, like a future I never thought I’d be allowed to want."
